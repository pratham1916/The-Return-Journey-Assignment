# The Return Journey (Frontend Developer Coding Assignment)

I built a React application that efficiently displays and filters a list of items. By focusing on optimization techniques and state management, I ensured smooth performance and responsiveness.

## Features

- **Real-time Item Filtering:** Users can search and filter the displayed items instantly.
- **Optimized Rendering:** Utilizes React.memo to minimize unnecessary re-renders of item components.
- **State Management:** Implements Redux Toolkit for efficient state management of items and search input.
- **Custom Hooks:** Creates hooks for managing search input and filtering logic to enhance performance.
- **Unit Testing:**  Includes tests to validate functionality and reliability of components.
- **Pagination:**  Implements pagination to improve loading times and user experience.

## How to Install and Run My Project Local System!
To get the application running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pratham1916/The-Return-Journey-Assignment.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd The-Return-Journey-Assignment
    ```
3. Install dependencies and run locally:
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```
4. Unit tests for the Redux slice and components have been written. To run the tests, use:
    ```bash
    npm test
    ```
